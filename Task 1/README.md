# Python Course

This course was really good for getting started with python. It taught me the basic syntax and functions of python while also giving a brief about Object Oriented Programming in Python the final project was to implement a word cloud I did that by first removing punctuation marks from the text then I used split to convert it into a list then if the word was not in the "uninteresting words" i appened it to the clean words list and finally iterated over the clean words and added it to the frequency dictionary.
