## <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning" > Neural Networks and Deep Learning </a>
  
This is the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization it involved me getting familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to my own applications.

## <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network"> Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization </a>

This is the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization it involved me getting familiar with standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

## <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects">Structuring Machine Learning Projects</a>

This is the third course of the Deep Learning Specialization it helped me to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies for reducing errors; understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

## <a href ="https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks">Convolutional Neural Networks</a>

This is the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization it taught me how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data. 

## <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models">Sequence Models</a>

This is the fifth and final course of the Deep Learning Specialization it taught me how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs; apply RNNs to Character-level Language Modeling; gain experience with natural language processing and Word Embeddings; and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to solve different NLP tasks such as NER and Question Answering.
